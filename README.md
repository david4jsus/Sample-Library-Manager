# Sample Library Manager (I'm bad at names, so that's what this project is called, because that's what this is)
## What is this app?
This app is a simple (work in progress) desktop app for Windows, Linux and Mac that serves as a manager for audio sample libraries and files, making it easier to find the audio files you need when working on music production, audio editing, or any other audio workflow.
## What tech is used in this app?
I am currently using the following frameworks and technologies to build this app:
- [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node), for building this project.
- [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), to make things easier in the way of cross-platform app making.
- [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react), to make it easier to create UI for the app.
## Is this thing done yet?
Nope, still working on it as I learn more about Electron, but I will update this section once this project has its first release.
